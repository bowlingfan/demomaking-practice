# bowling_demos
This is a collection of demos that i've created to try out Graphics Programming using TIC-80 and Python! Started on 12/23/2025 and hoping to build more overtime. I hope you will enjoy some of the visuals I've made here. All are open source _and_ some can be played immediately by downloading the [binary-release](https://github.com/bowlingfan/bowling_demos/releases ) file or testing it online!

## Notes
Not all programs have been compiled to a binary file for release, but these can be directly copied and pasted onto the TIC-80 code editor and is guaranteed to work. (**YOU MUST copy and paste the entire code, including the comments at the top of each python program.**)

You also have the ability to download the cartridges themselves [here](https://github.com/bowlingfan/bowling_demos/tree/main/DEMOS%20(.tic)).
